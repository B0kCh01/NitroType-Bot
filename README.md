# Python Nitro-Type Bot

**ML Nitro Type bot by b0kch01**
Thanks Google for tesseract

</div>

# About
- This is one of the **coolest** Python typing bots out there, that exploits
Nitro-Type's unlimited errors game function. By mass sending a bunch of text,
the car will move, without the worry of backspace.

- This project is not ready for the common user, as it requires
some knowledge of python modules, command line interfaces, and adding programs
to ```PATH```

## How to use

```
(Mouse on top left corner)
[PRESS 1]----------------------|
|        Cover the whole       |
|        textbox               |
|        for the best          |
|        result!               |
|        Happy Racing!         |

# Notes
- The bot uses image recognition, so make sure nothing blocks the text!
That includes, but not limited to:
    - Your coursor
    - Other windows
- The CAPS lock pop-up warning has messed up results before (watch out!)
- Making the text area smaller or will help with faster recognition

Also,

## Compatibility
- macOS: Works but keyboard emulating is per key type
- Windows 10: Works well

- Slow computers beware.
