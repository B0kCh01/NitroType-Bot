# Python Nitro-Type Bot

**ML Nitro Type bot by b0kch01**
Thanks Google for tesseract

</div>

# About
- This is one of the **coolest** Python typing bots out there, that exploits
Nitro-Type's unlimited errors game function. By mass sending a bunch of text,
the car will move, without the worry of backspace.

- This project is not ready for the common user, as it requires
some knowledge of python modules, command line interfaces, and adding programs
to ```PATH```

## How to use

```
(Mouse on top left corner)
[PRESS 1]----------------------|
|        Cover the whole       |
|        textbox               |
|        for the best          |
|        result!               |
|        Happy Racing!         |
|----------------------[PRESS 2]

# Installation
- **Important:** make sure you have _Google Tesseract_ installed with PATH added
https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html
- Windows:
    - Run latest executable from the <a href="https://github.com/B0kCh01/NitroType-Bot/releases/latest">releases section</a>
- MacOS (**Warning:** don't run unless you know what you are doing!):
    - Run with Python 3
    - Make sure to have these modules installed with pip:
        ```
        python3 -m pip install pyautogui pytesseract keyboard
        ```

# Controls
## Automatic
1. Use [1] and [2] to set capture boundaries
2. After coordinates are set, press [esc] to start! 			
3. There is a 1 second delay before the bot starts
4. To stop the typing, hold [esc]

## Manual (coming-soon)
1. Use [1] and [2] to set capture boundaries
2. Hold [esc] when you want to bot to run
3. Release [esc] to pause the bot
4. Press the ``\`` or ``|`` key to exit


# Notes
- The bot uses image recognition, so make sure nothing blocks the text!
That includes, but not limited to:
    - Your coursor
    - Other windows
- The CAPS lock pop-up warning has messed up results before (watch out!)
- Making the text area smaller or will help with faster recognition

Also,

## Compatibility
- Windows 10: Works well (.exe recommended)
- MacOS: (**Executable in development**)
    - Again, **only run** if you know what you are doing!
    - ```sudo python racerbot.py``` (You need admin privileges to emulate keystrokes)

- Slow computers _beware._
